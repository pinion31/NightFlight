# NightFlight
A Nightlife Coordinaton App

NightFlight is a full-stack application created with React and NodesJS/Express/MongoDB. It allows users to search clubs or bars in their city and mark themselves as going to that spot with their Twitter handles. Users can also see who else is going to that club/bar via their Twitter handle.

NightFlight draws nightlift information via Yelp.
